# directIO
## Overview
A very simple Arduino Library adding useful makros for easier AVR port manipulation. The provided makros directRead, directWrite and directMode are faster and require less programming space than their default counterparts digitalRead, digitalWrite and pinMode, making them ideal for programming AVRs with tight memory or timing constrains. Non-AVR based boards are not supported.
